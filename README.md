# AT-take-home-test

## Brief
Create a simple product search page like the one below using whatever language/tech you feel is best and fetching the content from our API.

## Time Frame
I was given 2 days to complete this task. From Wednesday 8th February until Friday 10th February. 

## Technologies Used
Front End:
- React.js
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- NPM

Version Control:
- Git

## Planning
Since I was given a specific set of instructions and specific deliverables that I needed to meet, along with a general wireframe, I decided that I should start by thinking about which technologies I could employ to deliver an MVP. I felt comfortable with React so thats what I proceeded with. 
I then planned out how I should manage the stages of this project as it was relatively small however given the timeframe, I needed to work with haste. Hence the first thing I did was break everything down into smaller chunks. 
- My first thoughts was about how I would structure the app itself. Thinking about what components I would need. What pages would be appropriate to use here. 
- I was then going to focus on successfully fetching from the API and console.log the response.
- Once I successfully managed to do this I would think about how I was going to display the data. 
- Once that was done, I thought it would be appropriate to think about how the search functionality would work in this project and how it would work alongside the fetch. 
- Following that, I then thought about pagination and dealing with the data from the API. 

Once everything was working then I would focus on styling if there was time. 

## Wins, Bugs, and Future Improvements
- I successfully managed to meet all the requirements and deliverables. I was also able to complete it all in good time. 
- I think my code is easily readable and one could understand what was happening and where through the use of comments. This was not something I had heavily used before however I thought it would enhance my skills as a software engineer as it is good practice. 
- I was able to break down the project into small chunks that I could work on 1 by 1. I was very successful in this as the process was quite seamless and I ran into very few bugs which consumed a lot of time.

- However following on from the last point, there is a bug which is that users are able to spam click the load more button which could potentially cause the app to crash. 

- Future improvements would be to make the load more button disabled when there is an ongoing fetch request due to a users previous click
- Another thing which I thought could be improved upon is that when there is no image available, it would have been nice to have a suitable placeholder. 
- Finally, sometimes when a user searches for a specific term, the app takes a while to display the results.
